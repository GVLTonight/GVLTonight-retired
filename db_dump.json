His debut signing to Never Say Die Records ‘Like A Boss’ EP went straight to the top 5 on the Beatport dubstep charts and rode high in the top 10 for 7 weeks running.Since then he has moved on to collaborate with artists such as MUST DIE! and Habstrakt which resulted in ‘Z’ and ‘Ninja Challenge’ which was featured on the Never Say Die and UKF album mixed by SKisM alongside names like Skrillex, Flux Pavilion, Foreign Beggars and more.With remixes for Datsik, Excision, Fedde Le Grand and SKisM under his belt, releases on Ministry of Sound and Sony, and 7.1 million views on YouTube, it’s no surprise that the 23-year-old wunderkind has been tearing up the systems of some of the best clubs and festivals around the globe.

After that.. $10adv/$12dos Big Something: Jam/Rock/Improv from Burlington, NC A 6 piece powerhouse with a sound that is both unique and timeless, BIG Something fuses elements of rock, pop, funk, and improvisation to take listeners on a journey through a myriad of musical styles. It&#39;s no secret why this group has quickly become one of the most exciting new bands to emerge from the Southeast. Soaring guitars, synths, horns and alluring vocal hooks rise to the top of their infectious collection of songs and represent a sound that has caught the ears of such revered Summer circuit stalwarts as Galactic, moe., Robert Randolph, and even The B52s who have all tapped Big Something as direct support.The group&#39;s most recent release and 3rd full-length studio album - Truth Serum – was recorded with the help of Grammy-nominated producer John Custer. Cut almost entirely live in the studio, Truth Serum, is a great snapshot of the magic the band is capable of creating on stage. The album, which also features an appearance from DJ Logic, was named 2014 Album of the Year by The Homegrown Music Network, which makes Big Something the only band ever to win this award 3 times with 3 different releases (2010, 2013, and 2014).

The musical intuition of each member overcomes the restrictions of any particular genre as they pioneer the musical trail with a sound completely their own. The name Jahman Brahman emerged from each member’s goal to achieve the ultimate state of musical cohesion; each instrument connected to one another to create a piece of music from the heart of one. They’ve described their particular style as shred ‘n’ flow, a dynamic sound with a wide breath of influence, but a focus on rich, fluid, progressions of energy. Providing the low end, Nate “Brother” Brown brings his own style of funked out and super fresh bass grooves. Layered on top are Daniel Combs&#39; transcendent key strokes and myriad of effects, which highlight Justin Brown’s full and conscious lyrics. Drummer Chuck Knott gives the sound its steady concrete pulse providing the heartbeat for Casey Chanatry’sriveting guitar-work. Combined, Jahman Brahman leaves the listener with a message on life, love, and the wonders experienced being part of an extraordinary musical family. Each member holds a unique passion toward many different audio paths, with influences ranging from classic rock to electronica; from punk to jazz. Instead of conforming, they ascend music through the coalescence of their diverse styles, taking risks that unfold into powerful jams and creative compositions.
