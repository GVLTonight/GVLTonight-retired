It&#39;s no secret why this group has quickly become one of the most exciting new bands to emerge from the Southeast.Â Soaring guitars, synths, horns and alluring vocal hooks rise to the top of their infectiousÂ collectionÂ of songs and represent a sound that has caught the ears of such revered Summer circuit stalwarts as Galactic, moe., Robert Randolph, and even The B52s who have all tapped Big Something as direct support.The group&#39;s most recent release and 3rd full-length studio album - Truth Serum â was recorded with the help of Grammy-nominated producer John Custer. Cut almost entirely live in the studio, Truth Serum, is a great snapshot of the magic the band is capable of creating on stage. The album, which also features an appearanceÂ from DJ Logic, was named 2014 Album of the Year by The Homegrown Music Network, which makes Big Something the only band ever to win this award 3 times with 3 different releases (2010, 2013, and 2014).

The musical intuition of each member overcomes the restrictions of any particularÂ genre as they pioneer the musical trail with a sound completelyÂ their own. The name Jahman Brahman emerged from each memberâs goal to achieve the ultimate state of musical cohesion; each instrumentÂ connected to one another to create a piece of music from the heart of one. Theyâve described their particularÂ style as shred ânâ flow, a dynamic sound with a wide breath of influence,Â but a focus on rich, fluid, progressions of energy. Providing the low end, Nate âBrotherâ Brown brings his own style of funked out and super fresh bass grooves. Layered on top are Daniel Combs&#39; transcendent key strokes and myriad of effects, which highlight Justin Brownâs full and conscious lyrics. Drummer Chuck Knott gives the sound its steady concrete pulse providing the heartbeat for Casey Chanatryâsriveting guitar-work. Combined, Jahman Brahman leaves the listener with a message on life, love, and the wonders experienced being part of an extraordinary musical family. Each member holds a unique passion toward many different audio paths, with influencesÂ ranging from classic rock to electronica; from punk to jazz. Instead of conforming, they ascend music through the coalescence of their diverse styles, taking risks that unfold into powerful jams and creative compositions.

www.soundcloud.com/truthdubstep Sonic architects of songs with an emotional heft as heavy as the subwoofer rupturing basslines that underpin their work, Truth are one of New Zealand&#39;s finest creative exports. Respected across the globe, since inception several years ago, Truth (Andre Fernandez and Tristan Roake) have, as both world-class producers and party-rocking DJs, cut a clear pathway through the international dubstep scene. On the nightclub and festival circuits, the fruits of their labor have included, several European tours, countless shows across the USA, New Zealand and Australia, a massive South American tour, and shows in Asia. Truth has built this performance presence through DJ support from Mala, Skream, Youngsta, Hatcha and N-Type, to name a few, giving their music an advance presence at key club nights like DMZ in London, Club Love in New York and through seminal radio stations such as BBC Radio One, Kiss Fm and Rinse FM. Through keynote DJ support, they have been rewarded with single releases via Deep Medi Muzik, Tempa Records, Wheel and Deal, Blackbox Recs, Aquatic Lab, Disfigured Dubz, Argon and Boka Records. Through these, including critically &#39;The Fatman&#39; (as released via Deep Medi Muzik) and their acclaimed Aquatic Lab released album Puppets, Truth have seen their stock rise, placing them as in-demand remixers and collaborators to The Nextmen, Miss Dynamite, Shapeshifter, The Black Seeds, Silkie, Kromestar, Tunndige, Datsik and countless figures of note within the international dubstep community. Acclaimed by critics both within and outside the dubstep scene, their momentum is undeniable and impossible to ignore. Face the truth or get well outta the way.

Outrageous costumes encouraged! To understand Bellaâs Bartok, imagine what you would get if Salvador Dali and Toulouse Lautrec were fronting the Moulin Rouge&#39;s house band, and you have the exuberant spectacle that is Bella&#39;s Bartok. Described as &quot;about as much fun as you can have with your pants on&quot; (Dan Wolovick, Two Way Monologues), this 6-piece powerhouse melds Bohemian Klezmer Punk with pop sensibilities into an eminently danceable party. The diversity of musicians that make up Bella&#39;s Bartok, combined with their boundless energy on stage, has been known to break a dancefloor, or two (or three, but who&#39;s counting?). Their sound moves way beyond labels, pushing the envelope towards the darker side of Eastern European music, referencing vaudeville and 20th century eclecticism.

TROLLPHACE, RA, & More! / IPA / Greenville, SC","description":" KARMA GROOVES presents TROLLPHACE IPA - Greenville, SC Friday, April 7, 2017 __________________________ TROLLPHACE //Los Angeles, CA www.facebook.com/TrollPhace twitter.com/TrollPhaceMusic instagram.com/trollphace soundcloud.com/trollphace youtube.com/trollphaceofficial TrollPhace, aka Damon Orienti, has quickly established himself as one of the filthiest and most violent producers in the game. Too complex to be qualified simply as Dubstep, his evil and aggressive sound makes run-of-the-mill bass music appear mild-mannered at worst. Proving to be a momentous year, in 2014 the Atlanta-based producer has already enjoyed: a Reddit shoutout from Skrillex, who instructed fans to, âCheck out this kid...making SICK tunesâ, a Main Stage appearance at Ultra Music Festival alongside Diplo and Skrillex as Jack U and an OWSLA release. Not to mention the attention TrollPhace has received from some of the industryâs heaviest hitters including 12th Planet, Zedâs Dead and Datsik. More than a filthy producer, TrollPhace is a monster behind the decks. His ground-shaking sets seem to beg the question, how violent can we get? Blending together his unique hip-hop influenced and aggressive tracks, TrollPhace leaves crowds begging for more. With a nationwide tour alongside Mantis and Rekoil getting underway and a number of raw and heavy unheard tracks in his arsenal, TrollPhace will without a doubt continue to prove the substance behind his monstrous reputation.

Alehouse","venueUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/ipagreenville/","title":"Town Mountain","description":" $7 adv / $10 DOS Raw, soulful, and with plenty of swagger, Town Mountain, based in Asheville, NC, released their 5th studio album, Southern Crescent, on April 1, 2016 on LoHi Records. Produced and engineered by GRAMMY winner Dirk Powell, Southern Crescent was recorded in Powellâs studio The Cypress House in south-central Louisiana town of Breaux Bridge. It was mixed by Mixed by Scott Vestal at Digital Underground in Greenbrier, TN. Since itâs release the band debuted on the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium stages bringing their sound to new audiences. The critically acclaimed album debuted at #4 on the Billboard Bluegrass Chart while staying for ten weeks on the Americana Music Associationâs radio chartâs Top 40. No Depressionâs Amos Perrine names Town Mountain as, âthe most exciting bluegrass band to come along in a long time,â which is echoed by Music City Rootsâ Craig Havighurstâs sentiments, âIâd put Town Mountain on my list of Five Bluegrass Bands You Must Know in 2016, because while the genre has forked and morphed in wonderful ways, these guys from Asheville have more Flatt & Scruggs and more Jimmy Martin in their sound than any young band I can think of. And when they do nod to other influences, they tend to be from parallels to the early bluegrass era, like Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins for example.â Up for a 2016 Emerging Artist Award with IBMA and the 2013 winners of IBMA Momentum Awards for Performance Band and Vocalist of the Year (Robert Greer), Town Mountain has earned raves for their hard-driving sound, their in-house songwriting and the honky-tonk edge that permeates their exhilarating live performances. With an insatiable musical hunger, the members of Town Mountain are Robert Greer on vocals and guitar, Jesse Langlais on banjo and vocals, Phil Barker on mandolin and vocals, Jack Devereux on fiddle, and Adam Chaffins on bass. Please note Bobby Britt (fiddle) and Nick DiSebastian (bass) perform on the album. The album was recorded in a decidedly old-school way, live, with minimal fixes and overdubs, with all the musicians in the same room and no noise-reducing baffling between them. Each of Town Mountainâs members contributed songs to Southern Crescent, with Barker, Langlais, and Greer the chief writers in the band.
