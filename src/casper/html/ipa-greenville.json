Outrageous costumes encouraged! To understand Bella’s Bartok, imagine what you would get if Salvador Dali and Toulouse Lautrec were fronting the Moulin Rouge&#39;s house band, and you have the exuberant spectacle that is Bella&#39;s Bartok. Described as &quot;about as much fun as you can have with your pants on&quot; (Dan Wolovick, Two Way Monologues), this 6-piece powerhouse melds Bohemian Klezmer Punk with pop sensibilities into an eminently danceable party. The diversity of musicians that make up Bella&#39;s Bartok, combined with their boundless energy on stage, has been known to break a dancefloor, or two (or three, but who&#39;s counting?). Their sound moves way beyond labels, pushing the envelope towards the darker side of Eastern European music, referencing vaudeville and 20th century eclecticism.

Too complex to be qualified simply as Dubstep, his evil and aggressive sound makes run-of-the-mill bass music appear mild-mannered at worst. Proving to be a momentous year, in 2014 the Atlanta-based producer has already enjoyed: a Reddit shoutout from Skrillex, who instructed fans to, “Check out this kid...making SICK tunes”, a Main Stage appearance at Ultra Music Festival alongside Diplo and Skrillex as Jack U and an OWSLA release. Not to mention the attention TrollPhace has received from some of the industry’s heaviest hitters including 12th Planet, Zed’s Dead and Datsik. More than a filthy producer, TrollPhace is a monster behind the decks. His ground-shaking sets seem to beg the question, how violent can we get? Blending together his unique hip-hop influenced and aggressive tracks, TrollPhace leaves crowds begging for more. With a nationwide tour alongside Mantis and Rekoil getting underway and a number of raw and heavy unheard tracks in his arsenal, TrollPhace will without a doubt continue to prove the substance behind his monstrous reputation.
