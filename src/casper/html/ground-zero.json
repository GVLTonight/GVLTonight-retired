Dreams","description":" with Varials, Deadships, Persistent Shadow<br> In today&#39;s hardcore/metal scene, it&#39;s easy for anyone to become jaded by the constant clones of, what is basically, the same band with hundreds of different names. We&#39;ve all heard it; the same riff accompanied by the growling vocals and simultaneous &quot;chug-chug&quot; breakdowns. So, we wait and maybe search the music section on Myspace for a breath of fresh air. Thankfully, hidden in the obscure depths of the internet are bands that give this genre hope, and if you look hard enough, you can find them.One of these noteworthy bands is Lansing, Michigan&#39;s well kept secret, For the Fallen Dreams. Formed in late 2003 and recently signing with Rise Records (The Devil Wears Prada, Drop Dead Gorgeous) in the summer of 2007, these young men show incredible promise through songs that showcase poignant and powerful writing, both lyrically and musically while still staying in touch with their hardcore/metal roots. Their music displays a well-done balance of metal and melody. Guitarists, Jim Hocking and Chris Cain show a variety of ranges while shifting back and forth between hard-hitting metal riffs and some rather melodic guitar lines. Given their ability to draw the listener in with brutally honest lyrics about life, relationships, and struggle, the band shows solidarity for their future as a band to be taken seriously.With 2010 shaping up to be a pretty big year for For the Fallen Dreams, I think we&#39;ll be hearing a lot more from them. Dylan, Jim, Chris, Joe and Andrew certainly seem to be on their way to setting the bar for the future of hardcore."},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-23 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/eyes-set-kill-/E0-001-102139428-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102139428-5","title":"Eyes Set To Kill","description":" with The Nearly Deads, Blackwater Drowning, Murder Maiden<br> "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-23 19:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/nearly-deads-/E0-001-103006586-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-103006586-2","title":"The Nearly Deads","description":null},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-27 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/vader-internal-bleeding-/E0-001-099627270-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-099627270-9","title":"Vader ,Internal Bleeding","description":" Vader , Internal Bleeding , Sacrificial Slaughter , Voices Of Ruin , Micawber Enthean $20 https://www.facebook.com/vader/ https://www.facebook.com/InternalBleeding/ https://www.facebook.com/sacrificialslaughter/ https://www.facebook.com/voicesofruin/ https://www.facebook.com/micawbermetal/ https://www.facebook.com/Enthean/ "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-27 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/vader-micawber-internal-bleeding-sacrificial-sl-/E0-001-101237583-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-101237583-5","title":"VADER- Micawber- Internal Bleeding- Sacrificial Slaughter- Voices of Ruin- Enthean","description":null},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-06-01 19:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/shallow-side-wnever-say-die-plus-more-ground-ze-/E0-001-103142942-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-103142942-9","title":"Shallow Side w/Never Say Die plus more at Ground Zero!","description":" Thermal Entertainment Presents: Shallow Side w/ Never Say Die "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-06-02 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/doyle-davey-suicide-/E0-001-102220666-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102220666-8","title":"DOYLE, Davey Suicide","description":" <br> "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-06-06 19:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/itsoktocry-/E0-001-102466282-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102466282-2","title":"ITSOKTOCRY","description":" <br> ITSOKTOCRY is a denver artist, known for his dark and stylized way of lyrics and flow."},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-06-10 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/addiction-kills-tour-featuring-jellyroll-kung-/E0-001-102393025-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102393025-8","title":"The Addiction Kills Tour Featuring Jellyroll , Kung Fu Vampire","description":" Jellyroll addiction kills tour wsg Kung Fu Vampires  "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-06-30 20:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/riverside-odds-municipators-drowned-out-ice-ca-/E0-001-101779681-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-101779681-1","title":"Riverside Odds- The Municipators- Drowned Out- I.C.E.
