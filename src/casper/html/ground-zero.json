Maya","description":" with Never I, Bleed Season, Annabel Lee, A World Of Lies<br> The Chicago based VEIL OF MAYA have definitely taken the hard road to success grinding it out on the road through countless tours over the years, but now that backbreaking schedule is paying off tenfold. This quartet are one of the few very bands that can authentically mix elements of progressive metal, melodic death metal, thrash and hardcore brutality together effectively, all while keeping the listener constantly interested with baited breath wondering just what is coming next. This is exactly why they will have a career for years to come.With their third full-length album, Eclipse, they continued to blend Meshuggah-esque riffs, shreddy solos and haunting melodies into a compelling package that garnered high acclaim from fans and media alike. With his overflowing riff bank in hand, the group have continued to churn out new material that has ultimately resulted in the new tracks that will be featured on a much anticipated new full length album (release TBA 2014) . The results are even more jagged and heterogenous with dizzying guitar savagery, jazz chords and fragmented leads congealing in a swarm of blast beats.VEIL OF MAYA are firing on all cylinders and remain one of the top artists within the genre never adhering to any preconceived ideals further pushing the envelope with each new track they create."},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-17 20:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/veil-maya-annabel-lee-bleedseason-world-lies-ne-/E0-001-102471161-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102471161-4","title":"VEIL OF MAYA- Annabel Lee- Bleedseason- A World Of Lies- Never I","description":null},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-19 19:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/reasondefine-anonymous-concept-broken-testimony-/E0-001-102232406-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102232406-1","title":"Reason|Define- Anonymous Concept- Broken Testimony","description":null},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-20 17:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/capture-crown-/E0-001-101354833-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-101354833-1","title":"Capture The Crown","description":" with My Enemies & I, Dayseeker, Kingdom of Giants<br> CAPTURE THE CROWN is Metal / Hardcore done the Aussie way.

We&#39;ve all heard it; the same riff accompanied by the growling vocals and simultaneous &quot;chug-chug&quot; breakdowns. So, we wait and maybe search the music section on Myspace for a breath of fresh air. Thankfully, hidden in the obscure depths of the internet are bands that give this genre hope, and if you look hard enough, you can find them.One of these noteworthy bands is Lansing, Michigan&#39;s well kept secret, For the Fallen Dreams. Formed in late 2003 and recently signing with Rise Records (The Devil Wears Prada, Drop Dead Gorgeous) in the summer of 2007, these young men show incredible promise through songs that showcase poignant and powerful writing, both lyrically and musically while still staying in touch with their hardcore/metal roots. Their music displays a well-done balance of metal and melody. Guitarists, Jim Hocking and Chris Cain show a variety of ranges while shifting back and forth between hard-hitting metal riffs and some rather melodic guitar lines. Given their ability to draw the listener in with brutally honest lyrics about life, relationships, and struggle, the band shows solidarity for their future as a band to be taken seriously.With 2010 shaping up to be a pretty big year for For the Fallen Dreams, I think we&#39;ll be hearing a lot more from them. Dylan, Jim, Chris, Joe and Andrew certainly seem to be on their way to setting the bar for the future of hardcore."},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-23 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/eyes-set-kill-/E0-001-102139428-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-102139428-5","title":"Eyes Set To Kill","description":" with The Nearly Deads, Blackwater Drowning, Murder Maiden<br> "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-23 19:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/nearly-deads-/E0-001-103006586-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-103006586-2","title":"The Nearly Deads","description":null},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-27 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/vader-internal-bleeding-/E0-001-099627270-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-099627270-9","title":"Vader ,Internal Bleeding","description":" Vader , Internal Bleeding , Sacrificial Slaughter , Voices Of Ruin , Micawber Enthean $20 https://www.facebook.com/vader/ https://www.facebook.com/InternalBleeding/ https://www.facebook.com/sacrificialslaughter/ https://www.facebook.com/voicesofruin/ https://www.facebook.com/micawbermetal/ https://www.facebook.com/Enthean/ "},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-05-27 18:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/vader-micawber-internal-bleeding-sacrificial-sl-/E0-001-101237583-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-101237583-5","title":"VADER- Micawber- Internal Bleeding- Sacrificial Slaughter- Voices of Ruin- Enthean","description":null}]}}
