The Washington, DC-based band&#39;s first for new label Sumerian Records debuted at #94 on the Billboard Top 200 charts today. It showcases each individual pushing themselves outside of their comfort zone implementing more clean vocals with expanded dynamic melodies rooted firmly in thrash metal with bombastic shredding guitar solos.Mike Schleibaum (guitars) states: Along with a new rhythm section, we also chose a very different route for the album&#39;s production this time around. While we have worked with well known producers in the past (Brian Mcternan, Devin Townsend, Fredrick Nordstrom), we chose a much younger and more local producer in Taylor Larson. He recently gained a lot of attention after his work with Periphery and after spending some time working with him we knew he was the man for the job. Tasked with making the most sonically modern, melodic and diverse DARKEST HOUT album yet, Taylor looked the challenge right in the eyes. He uncompromising approach to pushing us as songwriters and musicians was unrivaled. It took a young heart with a fresh perspective to get this album moving in the right direction and Taylor was the man in the driver&#39;s seat.Some metal bands barely last 10 years, much less 15 years. If a band does get to the decade-and-a-half mark, they&#39;re usually sputtering out or are teetering on their last, diseased and ready-to-give out legs. Rare is the case where an aggressive band mutates, growing stronger, more unstoppable and more menacing with every passing riff, scream and album. Darkest Hour are such a case.Darkest Hour rose from the ashes of the &#39;90s convergence of metal and hardcore and while most of the bands are dinosaurs or are dead and gone, Darkest Hour haven&#39;t yet touched the core of their potential, despite their impressive resume. They&#39;ve done a lot but still have more to do to fulfill their addiction to the music and their commitment to their fans and themselves. Sounds like a beautiful, complicated romance.The mighty DARKEST HOUR returned with their most accomplished and innovative offering of their already storied career. Look for them touring the world all year long. DH is back and better than ever."},{"stop_time":null,"start_time":"2017-10-13 16:00:00","url":"http://eventful.com/spartanburg/events/communion-darkness-v-black-metal-festival-2017-/E0-001-101171867-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-101171867-1","title":"Communion of Darkness V - Black Metal Festival (2017)","description":" Negative Realm Booking & Promotion presents the 5th annual Communion of Darkness - Black Metal Festival!
